Example Task: Create a Dynamic Todo List
Requirements:

    Create a React application that consists of a todo list.
    The todo list should display a list of tasks, each with a checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button to remove it.
    Users should be able to add new tasks to the list using an input field and a "Add Task" button.
    Completed tasks should be visually distinct from incomplete tasks (e.g., strike through or different styling).
    When a task is marked as completed, it should move to the bottom of the list.
    Implement proper state management to keep track of the list of tasks.
    Implement event handlers to handle user interactions like adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
    Use appropriate React components to structure your application.
    Style the application using CSS or a styling library of your choice to make it visually appealing.


Bonus (Optional):

    Add the ability to edit tasks.
    Implement local storage or a backend API to persist tasks across sessions.
